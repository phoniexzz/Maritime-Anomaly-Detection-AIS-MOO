# 🛰️ Anomalous Behaviour Identification in the Maritime Domain Using AIS and Multi-Objective Optimisation

## 🌊 Overview  
Maritime security is vital for economic stability and global trade. The **Automatic Identification System (AIS)** provides real-time vessel tracking, enabling enhanced **Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA)**. However, illicit activities such as *illegal fishing*, *smuggling*, and *piracy* continue to threaten maritime safety and sustainability.

This project proposes a **novel data-driven framework** that integrates AIS data with **multi-objective optimisation (MOO)** and **deep sequence models (Bi-LSTM)** to detect and classify anomalous vessel behaviours efficiently.  
By optimising trade-offs between detection accuracy, false positives, and latency, the framework supports both tactical and strategic maritime surveillance operations.

## ⚙️ Core Components  
- **AIS Data Pipeline:** Ingestion, preprocessing, and spatiotemporal feature engineering.  
- **Deep Learning Models:** Bi-LSTM autoencoder and predictor for behavioural profiling.  
- **Multi-Objective Optimisation:** NSGA-II algorithm for performance trade-offs.  
- **Evaluation Framework:** Tested on real-world AIS datasets (Spire & MarineCadastre).  
- **Visual Analytics:** Tools for maritime anomaly interpretation and decision support.

## 📊 Outcomes  
- 🚢 **Improved detection accuracy** and reduced false alarms.  
- 🧠 **Explainable and interpretable** detection framework ready for operational deployment.  
- 🌍 **Actionable insights** for enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) and vessel security.
